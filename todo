# 1. Render bars of spectrum.
#### milestone 1
- [x] 0. Rename Waveplot to BarPlot.
- [x] 1. generate test bars. For example: 1024 bars.
- [x] 2. make it draw with current shader.
- [x] 3. Improve current shader. Regardles position/index and size;
- [x] 4. Clean up code and refactor to make it more usable.
#### milestone 2
- [x] 5. Calculate FFT using existing crates.
- [x] 6. Pass FFT data to renderer.
#### milestone 3
- [x] 7. Add windowing function before FFT
- [x] 8. Create stream analyzer. With overlap option.
- [x] 9. Little refactor of code. FFT calculation present on AudioCapture side.
- [x] 10. Render present spectrum over mean spectrum.
- [x] 11. Add variable FFT length changing.
- [x] 12. Refactor. Extract spectrum related option to higher layer. Add to ui.
- [x] 13. Clean up code/refactor


- [x] <b>BUG: fix shader to render apropriate number of bars when changing length</b>

#### milestone 4
# 2. Render wave plot
- [x] 1. Make first shader
- [x] 2. Make code similar to bar for drawing.
- [x] 3. Improve current shader. Render test lines.
- [ ] 4. Clean up code and refactor to make it more usable.
